# 🖼️ Image Rotation System (OpenCV)

This Python script uses OpenCV to read an image from a specified file path, rotate it by an angle set by the user, and display the transformed image.

**🚀 Features**

✅ Reads an image from disk using OpenCV.

✅ Rotates the image around its center.

✅ Displays the rotated image in a new window.

✅ Checks if the file path is valid before processing.

**🛠️ Installation**

Ensure you have Python installed, then install OpenCV if not already installed:

1. bash

2. Copy

3. Edit

4. pip install opencv-python numpy

**📌 Usage**

Set the File_Name and File_Path variables to match your image file.
Run the script:

1. bash

2. Copy

3. Edit

4. python script.py

If the file path is valid, the script will display the rotated image.

⚠️ Notes

1. The image file must exist at the specified File_Path.

2. The script rotates the image without resizing or cropping.

3. Press any key in the image window to close it.

🎯 Future Improvements

1. Allow user input for file path instead of hardcoding it.

2. Add options for different rotation angles.

3. Save the rotated image to disk automatically.
